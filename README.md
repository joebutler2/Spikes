# What is this?
Over the years I would create many scripts and snippets of code to solve a tiny problem or to learn about an idiosyncracy of a language. Sadly they have been lost to the annals of time....

The goal of this repo is to prevent that from happening again. 

Hopefully this will be of some use to someone else as well.

Cheers!
